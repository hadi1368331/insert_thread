If those SDKs are not installed, the DMP sample applications are still presented as options. Attempting to create a DMP sample application may appear to complete, but subsequently will fail to generate because of unresolved dependencies on those SDKs. Subsequently installing those SDKs may not resolve the issues in that existing DMP sample application project.
